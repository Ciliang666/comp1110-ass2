I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method setStartScene() in class Viewer() using created buttons to trigger different scenes.
* The method addValidTiles in class Board() to check if a tile placement in the given board.
* The method bonusScore() in class Board() and its following helper functions, which get routes in the board
* and count the longest rail using recursion.

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of using recursion came from lecture.

* Some javafx codes to set fonts and color in Viewer tare hint by stackoverflow.
