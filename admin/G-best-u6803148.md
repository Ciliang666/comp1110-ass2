I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

The method public void drag(ImageView imageView, int startPointX, int startPointY, boolean single)in Viewer implement the 
function that if the tile is legal when dragged onto the board, it could be fixed, otherwise it will go back to the original
place.

I declare that this is entirely my own work.
