Review Comments:
1.Code features:
Code has good method names (e.g.handle, make controls), and good use of text methods and button method. But maybe could get all the tiles together to 
make the rotate button besides according to the centre of the image.
2.Documents:
All have comments, perfect.
3.Structure:
He Should packing the tiles I think maybe, because all the tiles have similar function(eg,drag to somewhere and fix onto it),
especially special tiles, but still have similar properties. 
4.Conventions following:
Lack fixed function, tiles can be dragged to somewhere else still after fixed on the borad.
5.Potential error:
It is hard to add more tiles unless write more similar function. If users have some bug operation, it will show some bugs on the screen.
