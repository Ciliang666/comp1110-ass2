I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage D of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The code of permutation in class <Board> uses an idea suggested by stackoverflow.

* The idea to use set to avoid duplicate is hint by stackoverflow.

* Recursion functions are hint by lectures.
