I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

The method myScore() in class Board() define how computer would choose to play according to the special score. 
The method placement() in class Board() make placement from moving options randomly
The method putAI() in class Viewer() make placement by counting the best score from all options

I declare that this is entirely my own work.
